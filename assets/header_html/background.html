                            In 2020, I graduated from University of British Columbia. I worked with Robots, Systems, and Software. My passion is to communicate with systems through software and look at robots as human. Robotics is a field with a combination of several science and engineering fields including, computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering. Before 2014, I chose Robotic Engineer as Robots were what I have been fascinated with since early childhood when watching science-fiction movies. I am still fascinated by science-fiction ones ðŸ˜Š <br>

                            During my master, I can say I explored University of British Columbia, University of Alberta and other Universities in Canada. First, I should say huge thanks to all professors that allowed me to explore the academic world. Second, I appreciate it that they were open to my ideas and guided me. It motivated me to explore several Robotic labratories and their robots. I really enjoyed working with Robots and spending my time with them. It was great opportunities for me to grow and find my self. During my study and working on a robotic lab, I worked in industrial side as well at the same time. It was the point that I found I really love to work in software industry.
