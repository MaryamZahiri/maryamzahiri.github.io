                            In this innovative project, we have developed a comprehensive medical AI assistant designed to revolutionize patient care. Our assistant can analyze patients' lab reports, track their calories through ICPHUB, and engage with patients via calls and chats to address their health concerns. Our vision is to promote healthier lifestyles by rewarding patients with health coins, ICPHUB, for their commitment to wellness.

                            Our project incorporates several cutting-edge solutions to enhance patient care and data security. We utilize blockchain technology through ICPHUB to ensure secure data management and an AI-driven approach to patient care. By leveraging decentralized AI on the ICP platform, we can accurately track food calories and maintain the confidentiality of patient data. Our pipeline includes an advanced image classification model from ICPGitHub, which helps determine the suitability of certain foods for patients. Additionally, we employ Eitheranm based on the kybra book for further analysis. One of the most exciting integrations is the future use of CKBTC for our health coins, incentivizing healthy behaviors among our users. Learning the new programming language Motoko (ICP Master) has also been a valuable experience, enabling us to build robust applications on the Internet Computer (IC). <br>

                            Furthermore, our AI assistant analyzes patients' lab reports using OpenAI and interacts with patients through nexusGPT in a Telegram bot. This AI agent also assists in booking doctor appointments with Contacti.AI, streamlining the process for patients. To gain insights into our user base, we have connected interview forms to a Couchbase database, allowing us to visualize customers' occupations and age ranges, with plans to implement RAG analysis in the future.

                            Our medical AI assistant represents a significant leap forward in patient care by combining AI, blockchain, and innovative programming languages. By providing personalized health advice, tracking caloric intake, and securing patient data, our assistant empowers patients to lead healthier lives. With the added incentive of health coins, we encourage sustained wellness and engagement. As we continue to integrate advanced technologies and refine our approach, we are excited about the future possibilities in healthcare innovation.
