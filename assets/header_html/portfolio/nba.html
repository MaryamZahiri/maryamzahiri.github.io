                        This project focused on implementing shot meter detection for a basketball game simulation using computer vision techniques. Leveraging a pre-trained YOLOv5 model, the system was designed to detect players and their shot meters in real time, improving gameplay interaction.

                        <strong>Player Detection: </strong><br>
                        Utilized a pre-trained YOLOv5 model for detecting players in pre-recorded basketball gameplay footage. <br>

                        <strong>Model Customization and Fine-Tuning:</strong> <br>
                        Customized the person detection model and player-specific datasets to improve detection accuracy for shot opportunities. <br>

                        <strong>Experimentation Environment:</strong> <br>
                        The model was tested in a non-real-time environment using Google Colab to fine-tune and analyze the performance on pre-recorded videos.

                    <h2 class="page-heading">How NBA Detection: </h2>
                    <div class="card-inside">
                        <strong>Model Selection:</strong> <br>
                        I chose to use YOLO (You Only Look Once), specifically YOLOv8n, for object detection.
                        This model was selected due to its balance between speed and accuracy for object detection tasks. <br>
                        <strong>Data Preparation:</strong> <br>
                        I prepared a dataset of basketball court images with various shot meters visible.
                        These images were labeled to indicate the presence and location of shot meters. <br>
                        <strong>Model Integration:</strong> <br>
                        I integrated the YOLO model into my project using the ultralytics library.
                        This library provided an easy-to-use interface for loading and running pre-trained YOLO models. <br>
                        <strong>Video Processing:</strong> <br>
                        My implementation processes video frames sequentially.
                        While not real-time, this allowed for continuous detection of shot meters as they appeared in the NBA games. <br>
                        <strong>Customization: </strong><br>
                        I customized the YOLO model for improved performance on basketball court imagery.
                        This included fine-tuning the model on my specific dataset and applying domain-specific augmentations. <br>
                        <strong>Post-processing Visualization:</strong> <br>
                        The detected shot meters were displayed after processing each frame.
                        This wasn't in real-time, but it allowed for accurate analysis of the detected objects. <br>    
                        <strong>User Interaction:</strong> <br>
                        My implementation included a mechanism for users to stop the video playback (likely by pressing 'q').
                        This allowed for manual control over the processing sequence.
                        My approach demonstrated a practical application of computer vision techniques in sports analytics. By leveraging a pre-trained YOLO model and adapting it for my specific use case, I created a system for detecting shot meters in NBA games for future.

                        While the implementation wasn't real-time, it showcased my skills in data preparation, model integration, and sequential processing. It highlighted my ability to apply advanced machine learning models to solve complex problems, specifically in the field of sports technology. The post-processing nature of the visualization allowed for thorough analysis of the detected shot meters, even though it wasn't suitable for live gameplay.
