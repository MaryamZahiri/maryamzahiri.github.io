                        Development of Human-tracking Robot using the QR Code recognition in Linux environment on Intel NUC. ROS-based processes for mobile robots (powerbot) <br>
                        One main issue in mobile robotics is the task of localization and navigation. A human-tracking capability for a Powerbot using the landmark as a
                        position reference is proposed as one approach to this problem. The Powerbot can
                        follow a person, an object or another robot as a leader. In this method, a QR code
                        on the leader is determined by the Powerbot. The Powerbot with a mounted camera
                        tracks the position and orientation of the leader’s QR code at high speed. There are
                        three steps in the human-following process. First, a leader marked with a QR code
                        is recognized. Second, location detection of the QR code applying a shape-based
                        pattern matching algorithm recognizes the position of the QR code. Third, the
                        Powerbot maintains a determined distance from the leader while following. The
                        third step is a robot-control experiment to demonstrate the accuracy of the tracking
                        algorithm.

                        <strong>QR Code Detection: </strong>A mobile robot with a mounted camera uses a vision-based algorithm to detect and recognize QR codes. The QR code on a leader (a person or another robot) serves as a landmark for localization and navigation. <br>

                        The QR code detection for a human-tracking robot was made using a combination of software technologies and a camera-based vision system using vision-visp. Here's a breakdown of how it worked: <br><br>

                        <strong>Software and Technology Involved:</strong> <br>
                        • Camera and Vision System: <br>
                        The robot was equipped with a camera to capture real-time images. The QR code was used as a landmark for localization and navigation. <br>

                        • Image Processing Algorithms: <br>

                        A shape-based pattern matching algorithm was used to identify and detect the QR code in the captured images. <br>
                        - The algorithm involved: <br>
                        Converting the image to grayscale for better accuracy. <br>
                        Edge detection and grid-cell generation to analyze the QR code's structure. <br>
                        The QR code's position and orientation were determined based on its recognition in the image, allowing the robot to understand the leader’s location. <br>
                        • Robot Operating System (ROS): <br>
                        The robot control part was integrated into a ROS-based framework, ensuring that processes like localization, navigation, and movement control could be managed effectively. <br>

                        • Control Algorithms: A control algorithm was implemented to maintain a specific distance from the leader (the human or object being tracked). It ensured that the robot followed the leader’s movements without deviating from the path. <br><br>
                        
                        <strong>How the Detection Worked: </strong><br>
                        Step 1: The camera on the robot captures the image of the environment. <br>
                        Step 2: The image is processed using pattern-matching techniques to detect the QR code in the frame. <br>
                        Step 3: Once the QR code is identified, the algorithm calculates its position and orientation in the robot’s reference frame. <br>
                        Step 4: The robot uses this information to adjust its movements, ensuring it follows the QR code (leader) while maintaining a set distance.

                        QR code detection aimed to solve the problem of localization and navigation in mobile robotics, particularly in dynamic environments.
