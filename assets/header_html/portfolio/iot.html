                        Developed a smart embedded system that automated processes, logged sensor data, and provided remote access to real-time data via cloud storage, servers, and custom web pages. The system was inspired by NASA’s methods used in space research, shuttles, and stations, while leveraging a JavaScript API for communication, which has received the 2020 Best Communications API award. I did the same tasks with a different approach. The result was to build a web application based on the data using microcontroller and Linux-based operating system using MySQL, PHP, Python, and C++, HTML.

                        <strong>Data Collection and Storage:</strong><br>

                        Integrated sensors into an embedded system (using Python, shell scripts, and C++) to log real-time data from IoT devices.
                        Designed and implemented scripts (Python and Bash) for automatic data extraction and uploading to cloud storage.
                        Used ARM and AVR-based microcontrollers, interfacing with various communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI) for data logging. <br>
                        <strong>Backend Development and Database Management:</strong>

                        Created and managed a MySQL database to store and organize collected data.
                        Developed APIs in Python to facilitate communication between the embedded systems and the web server.
                        Automated notification systems to trigger tasks and send updates via web requests. <br>
                        <strong>Web Application and API Integration:</strong>

                        Built a web interface using HTML, PHP, and C++ for users to access and control IoT devices.
                        Developed dynamic content and real-time data updates using the API, ensuring that the system sends data over the Internet without user intervention.
                        Integrated features for controlling devices remotely, including setting timers and executing commands from the web page. <br>    
                        <strong>Automation and Maintenance:</strong>

                        Implemented automation scripts (Bash) to maintain data logs by removing old directories on a monthly basis.
                        Set up the system to automatically refresh and reboot for continuous real-time operation, reducing the need for physical maintenance.
                        Debugged and maintained code through command-line editors, ensuring seamless operation.
