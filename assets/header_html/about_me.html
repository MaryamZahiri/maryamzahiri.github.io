                            In 2020, I graduated from the University of British Columbia. I have worked extensively with software, robots, and systems. My passion lies in communicating with systems through software and viewing robots as human-like entities. Robotics combines various fields, including computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering. My fascination with robots began in childhood, inspired by science-fiction movies. I am still fascinated by science-fiction ones ðŸ˜Š <br>
                            During my master's program, I explored several Canadian universities, including the University of British Columbia, UVIC, and the University of Alberta. I am grateful to all the professors who allowed me to explore the academic world and guided me, motivating me to delve into various robotic laboratories. The year 2019 was a turning point for me as I experienced studying at UBC, working in a robotic lab, and interning in industry simultaneously. These experiences were pivotal in my personal and professional growth, helping me discover my love for the software industry.
