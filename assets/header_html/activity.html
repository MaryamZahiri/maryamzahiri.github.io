                            I love sports. My favorite ones are ice skating, soccer, basketball, running, badminton, table tennis. You can sometimes find me in hike if I have time. In the past, I used to play lots of brain games in my childhood, as my mom motivated me to play, and chess was my favorite one. But not playing anymore. <br>

                                These days, I am listenning to audio books to improve my personal skills. The recent one was Atomic Habit by James Clear. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change her/his life by a right system design rather than goal-based one. You can find it on Sound Cloud. <br>
                                Last but not least, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, meeting with people from different cultures and collaborating with my colleagues. One big part of my learning is based on people experience and their positive attitudes.
