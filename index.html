                <h2>About me: </h2>
                Hi! Iâ€™m Maryam Zahiri, a Software Engineer. Recently, I am working on game industry and developing game pack and working on top of games. I enjoy working on sport games as my favorite activity is sport. I learned and still learning several languages, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Gaming Programming Codes, python, and bash. I love to learn new things by my self and explore new stuff. Challenges make me more creative and is more enjoyable. I like the idea beyond brainstorm and breaking down the problem.

                <h2>My Background: </h2>
                In 2020, I graduated from University of British Columbia. I worked with Robots, Systems, and Software. My passion is to communicate with systems through software and look at robots as human. Robotics is a field that in the interface of several science and engineering fields including, electrical, computer science and mechanical engineering. Before 2014, I chose Robotic Engineer as Robots were what I have been fascinated with since early childhood when watching science-fiction movies. I am still fascinated by science-fiction ones ðŸ˜Š

                <h2>Extracurricular Activities: </h2>
                I love sports. My favorite ones are ice skating, soccer, basketball, running, badminton, table tennis. You can sometimes find me in hike if I have time. In the past, I used to play lots of brain games in my childhood, as my mom motivated me to play, and chess was my favorite one. But not playing anymore. <br>
                <h3>When I was teenager:</h3>

                <li>Scored 1st in the IQ test among 500 peer high school students.</li>
                <li>Leader of the choir with 1st rank achievement in the city.</li> 
                <li>Selected calligrapher.</li>	
                <li>Ranked 2nd in story writer in nationwide artistic-cultural competition. I still feel I like writing.</li>
                <h3>During my bachelor:</h3> 
                <li>Mentored over 100 students of grade-12 for selecting university major based on their interests and capabilities.</li>  
                <h3>Recently:</h3> 
                These days, I am listenning to audio books to improve my personal skills. The recent one that I finished was Atomic Habit by James Clear. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change her/his life by a right system design rather than goal-based one. You can find it from Sound Cloud. <br>
                Last but not least, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, meeting with multi-culture people and collaborating with my colleagues. One big part of my learning is based on human behavior, their experience and positive attitudes.
