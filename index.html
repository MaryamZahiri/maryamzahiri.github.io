                            Hi! Iâ€™m Maryam Zahiri, a Software Engineer. Recently, I am working on game industry and developing game pack and working on top of games. I enjoy working on sport games as my favorite activity is sport. I learned and still learning several languages, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Gaming Programming Codes, python, and bash. I love to learn new things by my self and explore new stuff. Challenges make me more creative and are more enjoyable. I like the idea beyond brainstorming and breaking down the problem.

                            In 2020, I graduated from University of British Columbia. I worked with Robots, Systems, and Software. My passion is to communicate with systems through software and look at robots as human. Robotics is a field with a combination of several science and engineering fields including, computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering. Before 2014, I chose Robotic Engineer as Robots were what I have been fascinated with since early childhood when watching science-fiction movies. I am still fascinated by science-fiction ones ðŸ˜Š <br>

                            During my master, I can say I explored University of British Columbia, University of Alberta and other Universities in Canada. First, I should say huge thanks to all professors that allowed me to explore the academic world. Second, I appreciate it that they were open to my ideas and guided me. It motivated me to explore several Robotic labratories and their robots. I really enjoyed working with Robots and spending my time with them. It was great opportunities for me to grow and find my self. During my study and working on a robotic lab, I worked in industrial side as well at the same time. It was the point that I found I really love to work in software industry.

                            I love sports. My favorite ones are ice skating, soccer, basketball, running, badminton, table tennis. You can sometimes find me in hike if I have time. In the past, I used to play lots of brain games in my childhood, as my mom motivated me to play, and chess was my favorite one. But not playing anymore. <br>

                                These days, I am listenning to audio books to improve my personal skills. The recent one was Atomic Habit by James Clear. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change her/his life by a right system design rather than goal-based one. You can find it on Sound Cloud. <br>
                                Last but not least, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, meeting with people from different cultures and collaborating with my colleagues. One big part of my learning is based on people experience and their positive attitudes.
