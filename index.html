            <h2>About me: </h2>
            Hi! Iâ€™m Maryam Zahiri, a Software Engineer. Recently, I am working on game industry and developing game pack and working on top of games. I enjoy working on sport games as my favorite activity is sport. I learned and still learning several languages, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Gaming Programming Codes, python, and bash. I love to learn new things by my self and explore new stuff. Challenges make me more creative and is more enjoyable. I like the idea beyond brainstorm and breaking down the problem.

            <h2>My Background: </h2>
            In 2020, I graduated from University of British Columbia. I worked with Robots, Systems, and Software. My passion is to communicate with systems through software and look at robots as human. Robotics is a field that in the interface of several science and engineering fields including, electrical, computer science and mechanical engineering. Before 2014, I chose Robotic Engineer as Robots were what I have been fascinated with since early childhood when watching science-fiction movies. I am still fascinated by science-fiction ones ðŸ˜Š

            <h2>Extracurricular Activities: </h2>
            I love sports. My favorite ones are ice skating, soccer, basketball, running, badminton, table tennis. You can sometimes find me in hike if I have time. In the past, I used to play lots of brain games in my childhood, as my mom motivated me to play, and chess was my favorite one. But not playing anymore.
            When I was teenager:
            â€¢	Ranked 1st in the city-wide 5K run among 100 participants and won award. 
            â€¢	Scored 1st in the IQ test among 500 peer high school students. 
            â€¢	Leader of the choir with 1st rank achievement in the city.
            â€¢	Selected calligrapher.
            â€¢	Ranked 2nd in story writer in nationwide artistic-cultural competition. I still feel I like writing. 
            During my bachelor:
            â€¢	Mentored over 100 students of grade-12 for selecting university major based on their interests and capabilities. 
            Recently: 
            The recent book that I read is Atomic Habit and recommend it to anyone who accepts to change life by a right system design rather than goal-based one. 
            Last but not least, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, meeting with multi-culture people and collaborating with my colleagues as one big part of my learning process is from human behavior, their experience and positive attitudes.
