                    Hi! I’m Maryam Zahiri, a Software Engineer in the gaming industry with a strong background in Software, Robotics, AI, IoT, and Embedded Software, holding a master’s degree in Mechatronics/Robotics from the University of British Columbia. With over 6 years of experience, I’ve focused on creating innovative, profitable applications that solve challenging problems while staying updated in the software and AI fields. <br>
                    I've worked in multi-team collaborations to enhance product quality and performance, contributed to cross-platform and multidisciplinary fields, and achieved first-place in hackathons, gained recognition as a valued networker. <br>
                    I’m passionate about motivating people around me to reach their full potential with a positive approach, treating each project as if it were my own company, and bringing my experience and knowledge to drive success.
